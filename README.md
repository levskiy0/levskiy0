## About

19 years in software development, 10 of them as CTO leading a team of 30.

Started writing code as a teenager, went through the full stack — from solo freelancing to managing large distributed teams and complex client projects. Shipped dozens of high-load systems across multiple industries: e-commerce platforms with delivery, payments, search and data synchronization; B2B services, CRMs, customer portals, monitoring systems for construction, finance, healthcare and real estate.

Beyond engineering — hiring and growing teams, conducting 100+ technical interviews, mentoring junior developers, lecturing CS students, supervising internships. Managing projects end to end: from first client call to production deployment. Stress-tested by years of tight deadlines, shifting requirements and production incidents - staying calm is part of the job.

Now channeling all of that into indie products and open source.
